# Basic Next.js App with Authentication, Middleware, and Dynamic Routes

This is a **basic Next.js application** demonstrating how to set up **authentication** with MongoDB, implement **middleware**, and utilize **dynamic routing** in a Next.js app.  

## Features

- **NextAuth Integration**: Secure authentication setup using MongoDB as the database.
- **Middleware**: Protect routes and enhance server-side logic with Next.js middleware.
- **Dynamic Routes**: Implement dynamic routing to manage scalable and flexible URLs.
- **Next.js Best Practices**: Built with `create-next-app` for a modern developer experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js >= 16
- MongoDB (local or hosted)
- A package manager like npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
